Please see the report PDF file to have a basic background about my work, 
and it's easier to understand my programs with comments.

============================================
### Files
 1. README.md/REAMDME.txt: readme file for basic explanation and background
 2. ML project report.pdf: Project report

 3. ML_project.py: Main program about evaluation of learning method
 4. ReadFile.py: Functions about loading data
 5. KNN.py: K-nearest-neighbours learning method
 6. Perceptron.py: Single layer perceptron and Multi-layer perceptron(sequential)
 7. MLPbatch.py: Multi-layer perceptron (batch)
 8. PlotData.py: function about plotting data into graphs 

### Output files:
 1. Output_first_dataset.txt:  experimental results about first dataset
 2. Output_second_dataset.txt: experimental results about second dataset

### Folders
 1. First Data Img: graph about first dataset
 2. econd Data Img: graph about second dataset
 You can easily figure it out the graph meaning from every files’ name.

 3. outDataClass:    first dataset folder
 4. outDataClassLDL: second dataset folder

============================================
### Enviornment and tool
 * OS: Mac OS X 10.10
 * Programming Language: Python
 * Python Package Install: 
   1. numpy
   2. matplotlib.pyplot (only for plotting graph)

============================================
### Run this project:

1. Run the 'ML_project.py' and get sample experiments for first dataset and second dataset.  (It takes around 7~8 minutes)

2. It will generate 2 output files 'Output_first_dataset.txt' is for first dataset and 'Output_second_dataset.txt' is for the second dataset. 

3. If you want to draw graph, just uncomment different part in the main function of "ML_project.py". 
(Please note: you only can draw one graph one time run, or all the graph will mess around)


####  Note: 
 1. If you want to run the new dataset. Just change the folder’s name in “ML_project.py” at line 504.
 2. You will have the first dataset and second dataset folder in the same directory having all the program files
 3. If you don't have the right folder's name like in line 504 and line 505, it may cause the program stop.
